	<h6>Effective Januray 11, 2021</h6>
<h6>What’s covered in these terms</h6>
<p>
We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to
establish what you can expect from us as you use our services, and
what we expect from you.
</p>
<p>
These Terms of Service reflect the way our business works, the laws that apply to our
company, and certain things we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service
help define our relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example,
these terms include the following topic headings:<br>
• What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services<br>
• What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services<br>
• Content in our services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content
you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, us, or others<br>
• In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to
expect in case someone violates these terms<br>
Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these
terms.<br>
Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we
encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete
your information.<br>
</p>
<h6>Age requirements</h6>
<p>
If you’re under the age required to manage your own subscription, you must have your parent or
legal guardian’s permission to use a subscription. Please have your parent or legal guardian read
these terms with you.<br>
If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms
apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.
</p>

<h6>Your relationship with myrefic.com</h6>
<p>
These terms help define the relationship between you and myrefic. Broadly speaking, we give
you permission to use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how
our’s business works and how we earn money. When we speak of “myrefic,” “we,”
“us,” and “our,” we mean ZhijieVisa Pty. Ltd..</p>

<h6>What you can expect from us</h6>
<p>
Provide a broad range of useful services<br>
We provide a range of services that are subject to these terms. Our services are designed to work
together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next.<br>

Improve our services<br>
We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. We provide
you with innovative features and as part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or
remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering
new services or stop offering old ones.<br>
If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering
a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as
preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.
</p>
<h6>What we expect from you</h6>
<p>
Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms
The permission we give you to use our services continues as long as you meet your
responsibilities in: these terms.<br>

We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer
common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our
Privacy Policy, Support Email, and other pages accessible from our policies.
Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we
have in the services.<br>

Respect others<br>
We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these
basic rules of conduct:<br>
• comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws<br>
• respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights<br>
• don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for
example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others<br>
• don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services<br>
If you find that others aren’t following these rules, you can report abuse. If we act on a report of
abuse, we also provide a fair process as described in the Taking action in case of problems
section.

the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure
you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.<br>

License<br>

Your content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you
have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you

What’s covered<br>
<p>
This license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.
What’s not covered<br>
• This license doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights<br>
• This license doesn’t cover these types of content:<br>
• publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a
local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common
knowledge that everyone’s free to use.<br>
• feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in
the Service-related communications section below.
</p>

</p>

and algorithms to analyze your content:<br>

</p>
<h6>Duration</h6>
<p>
This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.

stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two
exceptions:<br>
• If you already shared your content with others before removing it.<br>

engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their
search results.<br>
</p>
<h6>Using our services</h6>
Our services<br>
If you meet the age requirements you can use the subscription at your convenience.
You’re responsible for what you do with your service.<br>
Using our services on behalf of an organization

services. To use our services on behalf of an organization:<br>
• an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms<br>
• your organization’s administrator may assign a subscription to you. That administrator might
require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your subscription.

Content in our services<br>

Your content<br>
Some of our services give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available —<br>
• See the Permission to use your content section for more about your rights in your content,
and how your content is used in our services<br>
• See the Removing your content section to learn why and how we might remove usergenerated
content from our services<br>
If you think someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the
infringement and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the
subscription Accounts of repeat copyright infringers.<br>

Our content<br>
Some of our services include content that belongs to our — for example, many of the
visual illustrations you see in our. You may use our’s content as allowed by these
terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove,
obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices.<br>

Software in our services<br>
Some of our services include downloadable software. We give you permission to use that
software as part of the services.<br>
The license we give you is:<br>
• worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world<br>
• non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others<br>
• royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license<br>
• personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else<br>
• non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else<br>

Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we
make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly
override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.<br>

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software. Also, you
may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract any of our source code unless you have our
written permission or applicable law lets you do so.<br>

When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates
automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you
adjust your automatic update settings.<br>

In case of problems or disagreements<br>
By law, you have the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things
go wrong. These terms don’t limit or take away any of those rights. For example, if you’re a
consumer, then you continue to enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law.
Warranty<br>
We provide our services using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level
described in this warranty, you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.
Disclaimers<br>
The only commitments we make about our services (including the content in the services, the
specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are
(1) described in the Warranty section, (2) provided under applicable laws. We don’t make any
other commitments about our services.<br>
And unless required by law, we don’t provide implied warranties, such as the implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.<br>

Liabilities<br>
For all users<br>
These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. Specifically, these terms
don’t limit our’s liability for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation,
gross negligence, or willful misconduct.<br>
Other than the rights and responsibilities described in this section (In case of problems or
disagreements), our won’t be responsible for any other losses, unless they’re caused by
our breach of these terms.<br>
For business users and organizations only
If you’re a business user or organization, then to the extent allowed by applicable law:<br>
• You’ll indemnify our and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any thirdparty
legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to
your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional terms.
This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments,
fines, litigation costs, and legal fees.<br>
• our won’t be responsible for the following liabilities:<br>
• loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings indirect or
consequential loss<br>
• punitive damages<br>
If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those
responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys
certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.<br>

Taking action in case of problems<br>
Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably
possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to fix the problem,
unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:<br>
• cause harm or liability to a user, third party, or our<br>
• violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order compromise an investigation<br>
• compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our services<br>

Removing your content<br>
If we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms or policies, (2) violates
applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or our, then we reserve the right
to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include
child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, and content that
infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights.<br>

Suspending or terminating your access to our services<br>
our reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or nullify your
subscription if any of these things happen:
• you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, or policies
• we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
• we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or
our — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or
scraping content that doesn’t belong to you
If you believe your our subscription has been suspended or terminated in error, you can
appeal.
Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a
service, we’d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.
Settling disputes, governing law, and courts
For information about how to contact our, please visit our application contact page.
Indian penal code will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, or any related
services, regardless of conflict of laws rules.
To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in an Indian
court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law
prevents your local court from applying Indian penal code to resolve these disputes, then these
disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of
residence.

About these terms<br>
By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service.
These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.
These terms describe the relationship between you and our. They don’t create any legal
rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these
terms.<br>
We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our services.
But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.<br>
If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
If you don’t follow these terms, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re
giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.<br>
We may update these terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for
example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old
ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.<br>
If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll provide you with
reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch
a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or
responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove your
content and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by
closing your subscription.<br>
